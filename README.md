# CS230 Operating Platforms
Develop a deeper understanding of operating platforms and architectures through the analysis and evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each.

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I did well on explaining the differences between operating systems when it comes to server and client side. This part of the assignment helped me better understand the differences between Mac, Windows, and Linux when it comes to Servers.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
What I found most helpful was the organization of the document. It helped to work on one part at a time, then have my professor check it and give me feedback to use in improving my responses.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would go back and revise my code. I incorrectly added a return type to the constructor of GameService. This error made it that anyone can create the GameService class, which means it is not a singleton.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I feel I was lacking at first, by generalizing my work instead of putting the user's needs first. The feedback from my professor helped get me on track and putting my client's needs in the forefront. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because you are ultimately designing for them.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I initially approached designing software in a broad way instead of placing a focus on my user's needs. In the future, I will put an emphasis on my user's needs when I am analyzing and designing a software application.
